Play with Dockerfile 

The directives we will use in that excersie:

- FROM          sets the base image
- ADD           copies new files directories or remote file urls
- COPY          similar but doesn't support urls (see full differences in Docker docks) 
- RUN           execute a command in a new layer 
- ENV           sets an enviroment variable key:value
- WORKDIR       sets the working directory for any other instructions in the build (ex: RUN,ADD,CMD)
- EXPOSE        inform Docker that the contain listens on specific ports at run time
- CMD           provide a default for executing a container
